## HotelsGo Assignment - Ferdiansyah (courseit3@gmail.com)

*This project is an assignment from HotelsGo before the interview stage.*

In this project, i am using BLOC pattern with flutter_bloc package. This project can be run in both mobile platform (iOS and Android) and web platform.
I made this project to support concurrence/multithreading in both mobile and web, and i use easy_localization package to support localization.
I also provide an example of unit testing using bloc_test and equatable package.
Since the project is pretty simple, I don't think the use of DI (Dependency Injection) and Repository Class are necessary.
