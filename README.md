## HotelsGo Assignment - Ferdiansyah (courseit3@gmail.com)

This project is an assignment from HotelsGo before the interview stage.

In this project, i am using BLOC pattern with flutter_bloc package. You can run this in both mobile platform (iOS and Android) and web platform.
I also made this project to support concurrence/multithreading in both mobile and web, and i use easy_localization package to support localization.
Since the give API only have one endpoint, I don't think the use of DI (Dependency Injection) and Repository Class are necessary.
